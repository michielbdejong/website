# Statutes for the Cyberfoundation

## One Person Cells
Each member cell should be one full-time person. so  at first we're two cells. If a cell is in practice run by more than one  person, then it should be split up into smaller cells.

## Cooperation
Collaboration between cellmasters is encouraged though,  for instance pooling on-call shifts, teaming up to learn and develop, or  helping out with firefighting. this way we guarantee the  decentralization.
## Right to Migrate
To guarantee the user's freedom, each member cell  should make it very easy for users to migrate to a different cell, even  if it's to a non-member cell / amateur cell / your own server.

## Product Catalog
Each member cell will offer (at least) all container  images and functionalities published/prescribed by the cyberfoundation  at a reasonable price. This guarantees that everything will work  correctly for immigrant users who come from another cell.

## Open Finance
Finance should be public, so people can audit where  their money went. Cellmasters should make clear where the money come  from. It might even be money from advertisers / personal data, but it  must be specified!

## Abuse
The cellmaster will always act in the collective interest of  their users, to the best of their professional abilities, unless this  would get the cellmaster into trouble with other parties like copyright  owners or nation state governments. This may sometimes be against the  individual interests of individual users (e.g. shut down a spammer), but  an attempt should always be made to accomodate everybody's needs  (possibly at higher cost if more resources are needed), as long as these  needs are part of what these people may want from a "personal server",  and as long as container images are available that would cover these  needs.
